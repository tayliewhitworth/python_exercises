''' The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an infinite series that 
can be used to generate a numerical approximation of   1/π :

''' Write a function called estimate_pi that uses this formula to compute and return an estimate of   π . 
It should use a while loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is smaller than 1e-15 (which is Python notation for   10−15 ). 
You can check the result by comparing it to math.pi.'''
